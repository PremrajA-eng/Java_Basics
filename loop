Loop:-

To avoid code redandncy (code optimisation )
it iterate number of times.
if iteration is fix, it is always recomended to use for loop


Do while: it is use to iterate the block of code till condition get false.
if we want to execute loop body at last once, it is recomended to use do while loop.
