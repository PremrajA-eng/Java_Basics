Abstraction:
---> abstract Keyword
its a process to hide the implementation and showing functionality
abstract class 
-- it can have abstract as well as abstract method
-- abstract class can achieve upto 100 % abstraction
Note: we can achieve 100% abstraction using interface in java,
because ingterface does not allow any non abstract method.
All the method present inside interface will be consider as abstract
