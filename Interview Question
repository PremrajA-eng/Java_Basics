Terminology Used in Java :
Source code : Developer / Automation test engineer written program
Compiled code: javac compiler generated code.
Compiler: Responsible to Convert the source code to byte code.
Interpreter: it pass the instruction to compile code.
Compilation:  Its a process to translating the code into byte code.
Execution: Its a process of running byte code to get output.



Platform Dependent: An application compiled in one operating system , 
if its not run in different operating system then application is called platform dependent application.
the programming language is use to develop this application called platform dependent programming language.
c, c++


Platform InDependent: An application compiled in one operating system , 
if its run in different operating system then application is called platform dependent application.
the programming language is use to develop this application called platform independent programming language.
Java.


Types Of applications:
Stand Alone Application.
Internet Application.::  Web supportive application
                         Web application.

Java Implementation to achieve platform independency                      
Source Code >> Compiler >> Compiled Code.
Java File Extension:
 .Java (Source File)
.class (class file)

Java Program Development , Compilation and execution process:-

Source Code > javac compiler >> class file >> class loader >> Bytecode verifyer >> Interpreter > jvm > OS > Output

Java is platform is dependent or Independent 
java software is platform dependent. but java programming language is platform Independant , where platform is operating system.

Java Programming Elements: 
Class / Enum / Interface
Variable : it is a name Memory Location
Methods : its a sub block of class used to implement logic 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main basic programming elements: class
is main method mandatory for compilation or execution ? Execution

-------------------------------------------------
User define method and pre define method.
Automation test engineer created methods are user define methods  / and already presents are pre define methods.

___________________________________

Java Comment: its a discription about a basic programming language.
comments are mint to understand purpose of code.
// Single line comment
/* code */  multi line comment

Identifiers : 
# its a name of basic programming elements.
# ( Ato Z || a to z )
# 0 to 9
# only accept _ and $ 


Identifires is case sensitive
Identifier should not start with number.
